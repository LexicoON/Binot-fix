## About Binot

Binot is a native Android application designed to bridge the gap between spoken ideas and structured written text. Utilizing the native Android SpeechRecognizer and the generative power of the Google Gemini API, Binot accurately transcribes live audio, processes imported audio files, and transforms raw transcripts into readable, perfectly formatted markdown notes. 

Built with privacy and personalization in mind, Binot allows users to integrate their own API keys, ensuring complete control over their data and AI utilization.

## Key Features

*   **Intelligent Voice Dictation:** Real-time audio transcription featuring an automated system-volume override to prevent notification beeps from interrupting the recording process.
*   **AI-Powered Processing:** Leverages the Gemini 2.5 Flash model to summarize lengthy transcripts, tidy up grammatical errors, and translate text into multiple languages (English, Indonesian, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese).
*   **Mathematical Context Recognition:** Automatically detects spoken mathematical concepts (e.g., "kuadrat", "integral") and forcefully converts them into strict Unicode symbols (e.g., ², ∫).
*   **Audio Import & Playback:** Import existing MP3/Audio files for AI transcription, or playback your recorded sessions directly within the note interface.
*   **Advanced Note Organization:** Comprehensive local database management including custom labeling, multi-selection, pinning, duplication, and a dedicated trash recovery system.
*   **Rich Text Markdown Rendering:** Features a custom-built markdown engine capable of rendering headers, lists, italics, bolding, and active search-word highlighting.
*   **Secure & Local-First:** All notes are saved locally using Room Database. Users can export or restore their entire database via JSON backups.
*   **In-App Updates:** Integrated GitHub release checker automatically notifies users of new updates and facilitates direct APK downloads.
